IMPORTANT!!!
I was having some issues with gihub uploads and it would not allow me to upload all files at one time, and I made a couple mistakes messing up the directories.
The parent directory is 'data'
the following directories are 'fonts, menu, music, sounds, sprites, walk, walk_green, walk_purple, walk_red'.

When I upload future versions I will upload the paths correctly, I apologize for any confustion this has caused.


All of the following folders belong in a folder call sprites inside of the folder called data, should look like: data\sprites\Bouncer\bouncer.png... 
All images that are found in data by themselves need to be placed in the sprites folder as well, should look like: data\sprites\image.png...
